A TUI (Text User Interface) for visualizing Rust project analysis generated by [`rust-code-analysis`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-code-analysis).

---

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, you must analyze your project using [`rust-code-analysis`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-code-analysis).

### Recommended command:
```sh
rust-code-analysis --paths <project_path> -m -c --pr -O json -o <analysis_destination_path>
```
Once the analysis is complete, you can use this TUI tool to explore the results.

---

## Usage

Run the following command:
```sh
./rust-code-analysis-tui <analysis_destination_path>
```
Inside the TUI, you can browse directories and view a summary report based on `rust-code-analysis` JSON files.

> **⚠️ Warning:**  
> Directory navigation within the TUI is not yet supported. If you need to analyze a different path, you must exit and restart the tool with the new directory path.

> **ℹ️ Note for macOS users:**  
> You may encounter issues due to app signature restrictions. To resolve this, run:
> ```sh
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./rust-code-analysis-tui
> ```
> Then, restart the tool.
